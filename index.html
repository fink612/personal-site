          <h2>About Me:</h2>
          <p>I dream of a future where humans and computers coexist without frustration.  We are not yet there, but we have made great strides in recent years.
            With the advent of machine learning and artificial intelligence, and the global climate and financial situations, it's obvious our next moves are 
            crucial to our survival.</p>
          <p>Can we feed the world without destroying it?  Is there a way to create a circular supply chain in all areas of industry across
            all continents without a distopian oppressive world government? Why does science take a back seat to political partyism in 2020, hasn't anyone ever seen Star Trek?</p>
          <p>These are the questions I hope to answer with technology, and I hope to find colleagues and mentors that share my goals.  Cooperation across all divides is key 
            to a <del>brighter future</del> any future at all.</p>
